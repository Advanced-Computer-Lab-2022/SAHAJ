### How to use :
In our project we have two main folders: backend and frontend.
The **backend folder also contains three main folders: models , controllers, routes:
* **Models** : Is the folder where add .js files that include the schema for the specified Object(instructor , admin , course....). here is a link to help you https://blog.logrocket.com/quickly-build-schema-based-forms-in-react-with-uniforms/

* **Controllers** : this is where you add the functions you want to implement when you recieve a post or delete or get requests.

* **Routes**: it is where you specify the route for a post or get or etc request.
for example: "router.get("/" , Home)" => it means when recieve a get request and the path is '/' call the Home function implemented in the controller
